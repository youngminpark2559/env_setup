Resolve issues when building following project
https://github.com/TNG/boost-python-examples/blob/master/README.md

- You can run into errors when building
https://github.com/youngminpark2559/env_setup/blob/master/build/boost/Resolve_issues_when_building_following_project_issue_message.txt

- This error happens when you didn't speficy Boost.Python library which is built for Python3
(I didn't test with Python2, you can pass with no error if you build this project with Python2)

The solution for this error is to specify 
1. Boost.Python library directory which is built for Python3
2. Python which you want to use

- First you just perform following commands at the folder of project like home/young/Downloads/boost-python-examples-master
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ..

Then, you execute this command cmake -LA to see cmake variables you cam use

- I searched all variables from the result of cmake -LA
and final command you need to use if like
you should change directories which you are using.

cmake \
-D PYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/home/young/anaconda3/envs/py36boost_python_example/bin/python3 \
-D PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/young/anaconda3/envs/py36boost_python_example/include/python3.6m \
-D PYTHON_LIBRARY=/home/young/anaconda3/envs/py36boost_python_example/lib/libpython3.6m.so \
-D Boost_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/young/Downloads/boost_1_69_0 \
-D Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_DEBUG=/home/young/Downloads/boost_1_69_0/stage/lib \
-D Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_RELEASE=/home/young/Downloads/boost_1_69_0/stage/lib \
-D Boost_PYTHON_LIBRARY_DEBUG:FILEPATH=/home/young/Downloads/boost_1_69_0/stage/lib/libboost_python36.so \
-D Boost_PYTHON_LIBRARY_RELEASE:FILEPATH=/home/young/Downloads/boost_1_69_0/stage/lib/libboost_python36.so \
..

- Then, you perform make, and you will complete the build
